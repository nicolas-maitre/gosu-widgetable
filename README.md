# gosu-widgetable
A flutter (and react) inspired library for rendering widgets in gosu.

Before I begin the development (because it's already 11:15PM), Here are some of my related projects:
- I already made a much simpler widget library for the [ProgCraft project](https://github.com/Crepe-Party/ProgCraft). Look it up :)
- I also recreated basic React features in my [NotReact repo](https://github.com/nicolas-maitre/NotReact) (warning it's really basic).
